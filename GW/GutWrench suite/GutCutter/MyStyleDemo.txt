<h2>JANUARY 15, 1919. PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h2>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

A memorial to SIMON DE MONTFORT has been unveiled at Evesham, where
he fell in 1265. A pathetic inquiry reaches us as to whether SIMON is yet
demobilised.

A demonstration of equations, with a few Greek symbols:

/*
[alpha]^{2} + [beta]^{2} = [gamma]^{2}

x_{0} + x_{1} + ... + x_{infinity} = e^{(x^{2} + y^{2})}
*/

Solve for x (this was one of Einstein's favorites):

/*
x^{x^{x^{.^{.^{.}}}}} = 2
*/

For the answer, see bottom of p. ##39.

A correspondent, writing to a contemporary,

would have rested with the newspapers.

<h2>THE RHYME OF THE "RIO GRANDE."</h2>

/*
By Salthouse Dock as I did pass one day not long ago,
I chanced to meet a sailorman that once I used to know;
His eye it had a roving gleam, his step was light and gay,
He looked like one just in from sea to blow a nine months' pay;
And as he passed athwart my hawse he hailed me long and loud:
"Oh, find me now a full saloon where I may stand the crowd;
I'm out to rouse the town this night as any man may be
That's just come off a salvage job, my lad, the same as me....

  "Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i>, her as used to be
  <i>Crack o' Moore</i>, Mackellar's Line, back in ninety-three;
  First of all the 'Frisco fleet, home in ninety-eight,
  Ninety days to Carrick Roads from the Golden Gate;
  Thirty shellbacks used to have all their work to do
  Hauling them big yards of hers, heaving of her to
  Down off Dago Ramirez, where the big winds blow,
  Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> twenty years ago.

"We picked her up one morning homeward bound from Portland, Maine,
In a nine-knot grunting cargo tramp, by name the <i>Crown o' Spain</i>;
The day was breaking cold and dark and dirty as could be,
It was blowin' up for weather as we couldn't help but see.
Her crew was gone the Lord knows where--and Fritz had left her too;
He must have took a scare and quit afore his job was through;
We tried to pass a hawser, but it warn't no kind o' good,
So we put a salvage crew aboard to save her if we could....

  "Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> and her freight as well,
  Half-a-score of steamboatmen cursin' her like hell,
  Flounderin' in the flooded waist, scramblin' for a hold,
  Hangin' on by teeth and toes, dippin' when she rolled;
  Ginger Dan the donkeyman, Joe the "doctor's" mate,
  Lumpers off the water-front, greasers from the Plate,
  That's the sort o' crowd we had to reef and steer and haul,
  Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i>--ship and freight and all.

"Our mate had served his time in sail, he was a bully boy,
It'd wake a corpse to hear him hail 'Foretopsail yard ahoy!'
He knew the ways o' squaresail and he knew the way to swear,
He'd got the habit of it here and there and everywhere;
He'd some samples from the Baltic and some more from Mozambique;
Chinook and Chink and double-Dutch and Mexican and Greek;
He'd a word or two in Russian, but he learned the best he'd got
Off a pious preachin' skipper--and he had to use the lot....

  "Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> in a seven-days' gale,
  Seven days and seven nights, the same as JONAH'S whale,
  Standard compass gone to bits, steering all adrift,
  Courses split and mainmast sprung, cargo on the shift ...
  Not a chart in all the ship left to steer her by,
  Not a glimpse of star or sun in the bloomin' sky ...
  Two men at the jury wheel, kickin' like a mule,
  Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> up to Liverpool.

"The seventh day off South Stack Light the sun began to shine;
Up come an Admiralty tug and offered us a line;
The mate he took the megaphone and leaned across the rail,
And this or something like it was the answer to her hail:
He'd take it very kindly if they'd tell us where we were,
And he hoped the War was going well, he'd got a brother there,
And he'd thought about their offer and he thanked them kindly too,
But since we'd brought her up so far, by God we'd see it through....

  "Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> (and we done it too),
  Courses split and mainmast sprung--half a watch for crew--
  Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i> and her freight as well,
  Half-a-score of steamboatmen cursing her like hell--
  Her as led the grain fleet home back in ninety-eight,
  Ninety days to Carrick Roads from the Golden Gate--
  Half-a-score of steamboatmen to steer and reef and haul,
  Bringin' home the <i>Rio Grande</i>--ship and freight and all."

<h2>HELPFUL HOME HINTS</h2>

<h4>(<i>With acknowledgments to the Weekly Papers</i>).</h4>

To keep moth from a haggis, sprinkle well with prussic
acid or cayenne pepper. Repeat three times daily. (This
method has never been known to fail.)

An excellent germicide for wire-worm can be made with
two parts carbolic acid and three parts castor-oil. Rub
over the wire-worm with a soft rag and polish with a clean
duster.

To remove dust from whiskers, soak whiskers in paraffin
or petrol for half-an-hour and singe gently with lighted
taper.

To clean a carpet, take a small wet tea-leaf and roll it
well over the carpet. Then remove the tea-leaf and store
in a dry place. Take the carpet to the cleaners and you
will be surprised at the result.

An excellent trousers press can be made in the following
manner: Get the local monumental mason to supply you
with two slabs of granite measuring about six feet by two
feet and weighing about seven hundredweight each. Place
the trousers on top of one block of granite, place the other
block on top of the trousers and secure with a couple of
book-straps. Finish off with blue ribbon.--AUNT SADIE.

<h2>MORE REPRISALS.</h2>

That ass Ellis is a poor creature,
and, like the poor, he is always with
me. I think he is a punishment inflicted
upon me for some past error.

A short time ago I caught the "flu."
Naturally the first person I suspected
was Ellis, but I am bound to confess
that I have not been able to prove it.
Indeed, when he followed me to hospital
two days later and was put in the next
bed, I felt justified in exonerating him altogether.

The first remark that he made, when
he reached that stage of the complaint
where you feel like making remarks,
illustrates just the kind of man he is.
He accused <i>me</i> of giving the thing to <i>him</i>!

I answered his outburst with the scorn it deserved.

"Preposterous," I said.

I added a few apposite remarks, to which
he responded as best he could. But, medically
speaking, I was two days senior to him,
so that when the Sister heard the uproar and
bustled up it was he who was forbidden to
speak. She then proceeded to clinch the
matter by inserting a thermometer in his
mouth. I defy any man to argue under
such a handicap.

I finished all I had to say and relapsed
into an expectant silence. The Sister
returned after a time, read the instrument
and retired without a word.
As she passed my bed I saw out of
the corner of my eye that Ellis was
watching feverishly. An inspiration
seized me. I stopped her, and in a low
voice asked if she had fed her rabbits.
Sister isn't allowed to keep rabbits, but
she does. As I hoped, she put a finger
to her lips, nodded and walked away.

"Poor old man," I murmured vaguely
to the ward in general. "A hundred-and-seven
and still rising! Poor old Ellis!"

Ellis gave a little moan and collapsed
under the bedclothes.

An hour later Burnett went his round.
Burnett isn't the doctor, at least not
the official one. I must tell you something
about Burnett.

He is the grandfather of the ward.
Though quite a young man he has
grown fat through long lying in bed.
He entered hospital, I understand, towards
the end of 1914, suffering from
influenza. Since then he has had a
nibble at every imaginable disease, not
to mention a number of imaginary ones
as well. Regularly four times a day
he would waddle round the ward in
his dingy old dressing-gown, discussing
symptoms with every cot. In exchange
for your helping of pudding he would
take your temperature and let you
know the answer, and for a bunch of
grapes he would tell you the probable
course of your complaint and the odds
against complete recovery. No one
seemed to interfere with him. You see,
Burnett was no longer a case; he was
an institution.

He spent a long time by Ellis's bedside.
I suspect Ellis wasn't feeling
much like pudding at the moment. I
couldn't hear very well what was going
on, but Ellis was chattering as only
Ellis can, and the comfortable Burnett
was apparently soothing him with an
occasional "All right, old man. I'll
see what I can do for you."

At length the grapes were all consumed
and the huge form of Burnett
loomed above me.

"Why, Mr. L----," said the soothing
voice, "I don't want to alarm you,
but really--"

"Really what?" I cried, starting up
in bed at the gravity of his tone.

"Well, you know--your colour; I perhaps--"

He fumbled in the folds of his voluminous
gown and produced a small
metal mirror. Then he seemed
to change his mind and put it back again.

"I'd better not," he said softly to
himself, and then louder to me, "Have
you got a wife--or perhaps a mother?"

I am no coward, but I confess I was
trembling by this time.

"Why?" I cried. "Do you think I
ought to send for them?"

"Send for them?" he echoed. "<i>Send
for them?</i> And you in the grip of
C.S.M.! It would be sheer madness--murder!"

The cold sweat stood out upon my
brow but I kept my head.

"Have an apple, won't you, Mr. Burnett?"

He selected the largest and began to
munch it in silence--silence, that is,
as far as talking was concerned.

"Tell me," I stammered; "wh--what is C.S.M.? And may I have a
look at myself?"

He cogitated. "Shall I?" he muttered.
"Yes, I think he ought to know."
Then quite quietly, accompanied by
the core of the apple, there fell from
his lips the fatal words
"Cerebro-spinal meningitis."

At the same time he handed me the glass
and selected the next best apple.

I looked at myself. My hair stood straight
on end; my face was whitish-yellow, my eyes
blazed with unmistakable fever. A three-days'
beard enhanced the horrible effect.

"Have you any pain--there?" One of his
large soft hands gripped my side and pinched
it hard, the other selected the third best apple.

"Yes," I groaned, "I <i>had</i> pain there."

"Ah!" he shook his head. "And
there?" He sat down heavily on my
right ankle. He is a ponderous man.

"Agony," I moaned.

"Ah! And something throbbing like
a gong in the brain?" he inquired,
tapping me on the head with the metal mirror.

I nodded dumbly. He rose, shrugging his shoulders.

"All the symptoms, I'm afraid.
That's just how it took poor old Simpson.
He had this very cot--let me see,
back in '16, I suppose. I had it very
slightly afterwards--it was touch and
go; I was the only one they pulled
through--but I only had it <i>very</i> slightly,
you understand--not like that. But
cheer up, old man. I've been told that
a fellow got through it in the next
ward--of course he's an idiot now, but
he didn't <i>die</i>. I don't suppose you'll be
wanting the rest of these apples, will
you? All right, don't mention it;"
and he passed on to the next cot.

When the proper doctor came round
a few minutes later (Burnett says) he
found his own thermometer quite inadequate
and had to borrow the one
that registers the heat of the ward.
When he took it out of my mouth it
wasn't far short of boiling-point, and he
wrote straight off to <i>The Lancet</i> about
it; also they had to get one of those
lightning calculator chaps down to count my pulse.

Long before I came to, Ellis had
been discharged, the ward had filled up
with fresh cases (except Burnett, of
course), and the armistice had been signed.

When I was well enough they
handed me a letter which Ellis had left for me.

"DEAR L----" (it ran),--"Yes, the
rabbits have had their food. The biggest
of them swallowed it all most satisfactorily.

"Your loving ELLIS."

<h2>ANOTHER HEATHEN CHINEE.</h2>

We were discussing "slim" practices
and the prevalence of the basic desire
to get something for nothing.

"If honesty," said one of the company,
"is truly the best policy, then
there is a surfeit of the worst politician."

"Yes," said another, "and not only
in the West. I assure you, speaking as
the director of an insurance concern
in Shanghai, that you have no monopoly
in inventive chicanery. Insurance
people must always be on their guard,
but never more so than among the
guileless Celestials. I can give you a
case in point. Not long ago we received
a visit from the wife of one of our
policy-holders, saying that her husband
was dead and claiming the money.

"'Certainly,' we said, 'the payment
will be made, but only after the
usual investigations,' and sent her back
to her village. It is not that we were
more suspicious of her than of anyone
else, but such formalities are essential.
In this case they turned out to be
peculiarly necessary, for her husband
was no more dead than you are.

"When she got back to him and explained
that there is always 'a catch
somewhere' in the insurance business,
he took alarm. A prosecution might
be awkward, and at any cost must be
evaded. He therefore played a masterly
card by writing the company a
personal letter of explanation, which
he pretended was despatched before
his wife's return. The original is in
Chinese, but I have an English translation
in my pocket-book."

The pursuit of odd examples of the
epistolary art being one of the principal
occupations of my life, I secured a
copy of the document, which in English
runs thus:--

/#
"<i>To the ---- Insurance Company</i>,
<i>Shanghai</i>.

"DEAR SIR,--When I died of a disease
that came on suddenly an intelligent
doctor was at once asked for. He
forced some fluid into my mouth and
made some injection on my body. He
thus succeeded in bringing me to life again.

"The beneficiary came to your place
yesterday. What did she say? Everything
will be discussed after her return.

"Kindly give me your valuable assistance and reply by post.

"Yours faithfully, TSIN KOH."

<h2>JOSHUA.</h2>

On July 1st, 1916, the regiment, in
company with several other regiments
and sundry pieces of ordnance, attacked
the Hun in the neighbourhood of the
river Somme. A fortnight later the
officers of B Company found themselves
in a dug-out in a certain wood. It is
now time to introduce Joshua.

Joshua was at that time
our junior subaltern, and we
called him Joshua after Sir
JOSHUA REYNOLDS, on account
of his artistic attainments,
though portraits by
the hand of our Joshua
tended rather more in the
direction of caricature than
those I have seen by his
illustrious namesake. Upon
the wall of that dug-out in
that wood, for instance, was
displayed a crude though
unmistakable portrait of our
revered Brigadier, a fact of
which we were but too conscious
when our revered
Brigadier paid us one night
an unexpected visit.

A short conversation ensued,
during which the Brigadier
gave rein to a reprehensible
passion he had for
inquiring into the <i>vie intime</i>
of junior officers. Just as
he was leaving he turned to Joshua.

"Why do they call you
'Joshua'?" he asked.
Joshua hesitated. His eyes
rested for an infinitesimal
moment on the portrait on
the wall, then on the face
of the Brigadier. He cursed
me inwardly (as he told me
afterwards) for having addressed
him by this name
in such strident tones just
as the Brigadier was entering
the dug-out; but for the
credit of the British Officer
I am happy to say that Joshua kept
his head and showed that ready wit
in an emergency which is the soldier's
greatest virtue.

"Well, Sir," he said, "I--I think it's
because JOSHUA was a great warrior."

"Ah, I hadn't thought of that," said
the Brigadier as he took his departure,
while I subsided in a fainting condition
on to the floor of the dug-out and asked
for brandy.

That night Joshua stopped a piece of
shell with his head. We managed to
get him back, but I did not like the
look of him and I quite thought that
his number was up. Before we pushed
on next day I took down the portrait
of the Brigadier and slipped it into my
pocket-book. I had liked old Joshua
well, and I thought I would keep this
as a memento not only of his art but
of his ability in spontaneous untruth.

That was, as I have said, in 1916.
Much water had flowed between the
banks of the river Somme before, in
August, 1918, Joshua and I found ourselves
in that neighbourhood once more.

But we did find ourselves there, for
Joshua's head had proved tougher than
we thought, and with an enthusiasm
beyond praise he had recently wangled
his return to the old regiment from a
cushy Base job, and was helping to
hasten what we hoped and firmly believed
was Fritz's final "strategical
retirement."

[Illustration R20: Fig. 5. Hounds of the Baskervilles.]

We had had three strenuous days,
and now, while others carried on the
good work, we were resting by chance
in that very wood of which I have
already spoken. I wandered forth at
eventide over the familiar ground, which
had lain for some time well within the
German lines, and came suddenly upon
the entrance to our old dug-out! I went
down into it and found that, apart from
a litter of empty ration-tins, it was unaltered.
Then suddenly I bethought
me of the caricature which still lay
in my pocket-book. I had never told
Joshua that I had kept it. It seemed
a maudlin thing to have done and moreover
might have given him an exaggerated
idea of my opinion of his art. I
took out the picture and
looked at it. It had weathered
two years of warfare
fairly well. Then with an
indelible pencil I scrawled below it--

/#
"<i>Sehr gute Bilde.
F. Biermeister, 3 Preuss. Gard,</i>"
#/

a hazy recollection of school-German
leading me to believe
that "<i>Sehr gute Bilde</i>"
meant "Very good picture."
Then I pinned it up on the
wall and went in search of Joshua.

"Do you remember that dug-out we used two years
ago?" I asked when I had found him.

"I do," said Joshua. "It was there that I told old
Turnips I was called Joshua
after the O.C. Israelites at Jericho."

"That's the place," said I. "It's somewhere round
here." And I led him unostentatiously
in the right direction.

"There it is," he cried. "It all comes back to me.
Got a flash-lamp?"

He disappeared below and
I sat down and waited--waited for sounds of astonishment
and joy from the bowels of the earth. But I
waited in vain. Silence reigned. Then Joshua's
head was thrust upwards.

"Biermeister!" he called. "You,
Biermeister of the 3rd Prussian Guard,
come away below here! There is one,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, an artist, would
have a word with you."

I shook my head sadly. Another of
my little jokes had proved a dud. But
I did not go below. Joshua is so rough sometimes.

<h2>THE WEARY TITAN.</h2>

/*
Weary of the labours of war-winning--
  Downing mandarins in Downing Street,
Fixing brands of CAIN upon the sinning,
  Bingeing up the Army and the Fleet;
Weary of dislodging Kings and Kaisers,
  Wearier of his friends than of his foes,
Prompted by his medical advisers
  He has wandered South to seek repose.

There to ease his cranial distension
  He will lead the simple life, incog.,
Far from international dissension
  Or upheavals of the under-dog;
Leaving all unread his weekly <i>Hansard</i>,
  Studying only novels at his meals,
Leaving correspondence all unanswered,
  Deaf to FOCH'S passionate appeals.

There, no longer rashly overtasking
  Powers impaired by superhuman strain,
But amid exotic foliage basking,
  He will rest his monumental brain,
Till refreshed, dæmonic and defiant,
  Clad in dazzling amaranthine sheen,
He emerges like a godlike giant
  Once again to dominate the scene.

There, recumbent in a chair with rockers,
  Oft will he indulge in forty winks,
Or, attired in well-cut knickerbockers,
  Decorate the landscape on the links;
Or, with arms upon his bosom folded,
  He will stand as motionless as bronze,
While his features, classically moulded,
  Hourly grow more like NAPOLEON'S.

What the Conference will do without him
  Hardly can we venture to surmise;
Delegates who would not dare to flout him
  Manifest their joy without disguise.
Freed from his relentless catechizing
  WILSON goes out golfing all the day;
Printers, save for common advertising,
  Sadly put their pica type away.

Still, although this act of self-seclusion
  May create irreparable schism,
Whelm the Conference in dire confusion
  And produce a cosmic cataclysm;
Let us, musing on his past achievement,
  Bear with calm our soul-consuming grief
And condole in their supreme bereavement
  With his Staff, deserted by their Chief.

<h2>A CONFESSION.</h2>

<h3>TO THE RESIDENTS OF CHISWICK MALL.</h3>

/*
There is a race of gentle folk
  Who dwell in Chiswick, well content
    In houses agéd as the oak,
  But not unpleasing at the rent;
They look across the sunny stream
  As Dr. JOHNSON used to look,
    And all their lives are one long dream,
  Though <i>none</i> of them has got a cook,
And there are whispers in the camp,
"It's jolly, but it <i>is</i> so damp."

But they are <i>not</i> exciting. No;
  And you would find that Chiswick Mall
    At half-past nine at night or so
  Is far from being Bacchanal;
For, though there come from Chiswick Eyot
  Soft sounds of something going on
    Where the wild herons congregate
  And revel madly with the swan,
You might suppose the people dead.
You mustn't; they have gone to bed.

No extra forces of police
  Were needed here at Armistice;
    No little European Peace
  Could tamper with a peace like this.
Yet on the Eve of this New Year
  A strange degrading thing occurred;
    A startled Chiswick woke to hear
  Such noise as she has never heard,
The sound of dance and singing at
About eleven. O my hat!

Yes, it was bad. But what is worse
  They know not yet who broke the code,
    And the dread Chiswick Fathers' curse
  Still hovers sadly, unbestowed
Nay, there are wild false tales about
  And hideous accusations made;
    Men say old Piper led the rout
  With that young fellow from "The Glade,"
While old maids murmur with a tear,
"I'm told it was the Rector, dear."

And since I would not see this shame
  Be fastened on to guiltless men,
    And hear that there are those who blame
  The Editor at Number 10,
As having found the evil ones
  And harboured them in his abode
    And, after stimulants and buns,
  Dragooned them, shouting, down the road
And carried on till two or three--
I say, O spare him; <i>it was ME!</i>

<h2>THE OPIUM HOUND.</h2>

Philip is a solicitor whose solicitations
are confined to Hongkong and
the Far East generally. Just now he
is also a special constable, for the
duration. He is other things as well,
but the above should serve as a general
introduction.

In his capacity as special constable
he keeps an eagle eye upon the departing
river steamers and the passengers
purposing to travel in them, his idea
being to detect them in the act of
attempting to export opium without a
permit, one of the deadly sins.

A little while ago Philip came into
the possession of a dog of doubtful ancestry
and antecedents, but reputed to
be intelligent. It was called "Little
Willie" because of its marked tendency
to the predatory habit. His other
leading characteristic was an inordinate
craving for Punter's "Freak" biscuits.

One day Philip had a brain-wave.
"I will teach Little Willie," he said,
"to smell out opium concealed in passengers'
luggage, and I shall acquire
merit and the Superintendent of Imports
and Exports will acquire opium."
So he borrowed some opium from that
official and concealed it about the house
and in his office, and by-and-by what
was required of him seemed to dawn
on Little Willie, and every time he
found a <i>cache</i> of the drug he was rewarded
with a Punter's "Freak" biscuit.

At last his education was pronounced
to be complete and Philip marched
proudly down to the Canton wharf
with the Opium Hound. There was a
queue of passengers waiting to be allowed
on board, and the ceremony of
the examination of their baggage was
going on. Little Willie was invited to
take a hand, which he did in a rather
perfunctory way, without any real
interest in the proceedings. Indeed,
his attention wandered to the doings of
certain disreputable friends of his who
had come down to the wharf in a spirit
of curiosity, and Philip had to recall
him to the matter in hand.

On a sudden a wonderful change
came over the Opium Hound. A highly
respectable old lady of the <i>amah</i> or
domestic servant class came confidently
along, carrying the customary round
lacquered wooden box, a neat bundle
and a huge umbrella. She was followed
by a ragged coolie bearing a
plethoric basket, lashed with a stout
rope, but bulging in all directions.
Little Willie sniffed once at the basket
and stiffened. "Good dog," said Philip;
"is that opium you have found?"
The hound's tail wagged furiously,
and he scratched at the basket in a
paroxysm of excitement. The coolie
dropped it and ran away. The <i>amah</i>
waxed voluble and attacked Little Willie
with the family umbrella. The hound
grew more and more enthusiastic for
the quest. Philip issued the fiat,
"Open that basket, it contains opium,"
and struck an attitude.

The basket was solemnly unlashed
amid the <i>amah's</i> shrill expostulations,
and the contents soon flowed out upon
the floor of the examination-hut. There
was the usual conglomeration: Two
pairs working trousers (blue cotton),
two ditto jackets to match, one suit
silk brocade for high days and holidays,
two white aprons, three pairs Chinese
shoes, three and a half pairs of Mississy's
silk stockings, several mysterious
under garments (from the same source);
one cigarette tin containing sewing materials,
buttons of all sorts and sizes
-----------------------File:  46.png----------------------------
nine empty cotton-reels, three spools
from a sewing-machine, one pair nail-scissors
(broken); one cigar-box containing
several yards of tape (varying
widths), cuttings of many different materials,
one button-hook, one tin-opener
and corkscrew combined, one silver
thimble, one ditto (horn), one Chinese
pipe; one packet of tea, one ditto sugar,
one tin condensed milk (unopened), half
a loaf of bread (very stale), two empty
medicine bottles--but no opium!

Little Willie was nearly delirious
by this time, and tried to get into the
basket, which was now all but empty.
The search continued, and two rolls of
material were lifted out: five and a
quarter yards of white calico and three
yards of pink silk. This exposed the
bottom of the basket, where lay a tin!
Ah, the opium at last. Philip stepped
forward and prised off the lid triumphantly.

The contents consisted solely of
Punter's "Freak" biscuits.

Little Willie has been dismissed from
his position as Opium Sleuth-hound.

<h2>HOW TO DINE WISELY--BUT NOT TOO WELL.</h2>

We are exceedingly pleased to note
that our contemporary, <i>The Pall Mall
Gazette</i>, preaches frugality in the most
practical manner by providing a daily
<i>menu</i> card, with helpful comments on
the preparation of the viands. The
time for an unrestricted dietary is still
far off, and it is a work of national
importance to encourage the thrifty
use of what our contemporary calls
"left-overs." Herein we are only following
ancient and honourable precedent,
one of the earliest lyrics in the
language informing us that

/*
"What they did not eat that day
The Queen next morning fried."
*/

Our only fault with the <i>P.M.G.</i>'s
<i>chef</i> is that he is inclined to err on
the side of generosity. The dinner for
January 6th, for instance, is composed
of no fewer than four dishes, of which
only one is a "left-over." The bill of
fare opens with "Kipper meat on
toast"; it proceeds with a fine <i>crescendo</i>
to "Beef <i>á la jardinière</i>," followed by
"Fried macaroni," and declining gracefully
on "Cabinet pudding."

"Left-over meat," as our contemporary
remarks, "is more of a problem
nowadays than ever before, for, being
generally imported, it is not so tender
as the pre-war home-grown meat to
begin with, and the small amounts that
can be saved from the rationed joint
rarely seem sufficient for another meal."
An excellent plan, therefore, would be
to provide all the members of the family
with magnifying-glasses. It is easy to
believe a thing to be large when it looks
large. Also there is great virtue in
calling a thing by a nutritious name.
"Kipper on toast" is not nearly so rich
in carbohydrates, calories and aplanatic
amygdaloids as "Kipper <i>meat</i>."
As for the preparation of "left-overs"
in such a way as to render them both
appetising and palatable, "all that need
be done is to add a few vegetables and
cook them over again." And herein, as
our instructor most luminously observes,
"lies one solution of the problem
of quantity, for the amount of vegetables
used, if not the meat, can be measured
by the size of the family appetite."
Once more the wisdom of the ancients
comes to our help, for, as it has been
said, "the less you eat the hungrier
you are, and the hungrier you are the
more you eat. Therefore the less you
eat the more you eat." The instructions
for the preparation of a sauce for the
"Beef <i>á la jardinière</i>" seem to us
rather lavish. It is suggested that we
should give the whole a good brown
colour by dissolving in it "a teaspoonful
of any beef extract." Walnut juice
is just as effective. If the "left-over"
is made of "silver-side," the silver
should be carefully extracted and sent
to the Mint. The choice of the vegetables
must of course depend on the
idiosyncrasies of the family. In the
best families the prejudice against parsnips
is sometimes ineradicable. But
if chopped up with kitten meat and
onions their intrinsic savour is largely
disguised. Fried macaroni, as the
<i>P.M.G. chef</i> remarks in an inspired
passage, is delicious if properly prepared
with hot milk and quickly fried
in hot fat. But, on the other hand, if
treated with spermaceti or train-oil it
loses much of its peninsular charm.

Cabinet pudding, if a "left-over,"
should perhaps be called "reconstruction
pudding." Here again the amount
of egg and sugar used must vary in a
direct ratio with the size of the family
appetite. Prepared to suit that of the
family of the late Dr. TANNER, such a
dinner as the above is not merely inexpensive,
it costs nothing at all.

<h2><i>LÈSE-MAJESTÉ.</i></h2>

Our triumphal march into Germany
having been arrested just west of the
Meuse, Sir DOUGLAS HAIG (through the
usual channels) gave me ten days' leave
to visit the historic town of St. Omer.
As I only asked for seven-days and he
gave me ten I knew there was a catch
somewhere. It appeared that the ten
days was worked out on the idea that
it would take me five days to get there
and five to get back. Needless to say
I ignored trains, which are a snare
and delusion in these days. I lorry-hopped.
Most people would think
many times before lorry-hopping from
Charleroi to Lille <i>viâ</i> Brussels and
Tournai, but there is nothing that a
man with a leave warrant in his pocket
will not do--except perhaps save money.

It was during this leave that I
barged right into GEORGE, "George"
being our very own King, besides being
Emperor of India.

To bridge the apparent gap between
my arrival and the perturbing catastrophe
referred to, it is only necessary
to add that if you enter from the main
route from Hazebrouck you will find
just off the road a convoy of some sixty
dear things seeing as much life as can
be beheld while groping into the insides
of the Red Cross motor ambulance
which it is their job to feed, wash, coax
and drive.

I have the <i>entrée</i> here (except when
the relentless Miss Commanding Officer
chases me out for breaking the two-and-a-half
rules which govern the place),
and when I admitted incautiously that
the only place on the Front that I had
not seen or been frightened at was
Passchendaele, they smiled pityingly
and promised to take me there on
Sunday for a joy ride. Shades of 1917!
What whirligigs of circumstance time
and the armistice have brought us! It
was in the joy ride we nearly upset a dynasty.

To accomplish the journey in greater
comfort, Vee and her hut companion
Sadie got hold of a perfectly good
Colonel man who had a perfectly good
car and had, moreover, a perfectly good
excuse to go to Passchendaele (he was
really going to Boulogne), but wanted
to get a good flying start, and we set
off. We were a perfectly organised
unit, consisting of four sections (including
two No. 2 Brownie Sections),
A.S.C. complement (one lunch basket),
Aid Post (bandage and thermometer,
carried as a matter of course by
Sadie, who thinks of these things), a
Scotch dog (mascot) and a flask of
similar nationality (medical comforts
for the troops).

On our arrival at Ypres the traffic
man held up his hand. That in itself
would not have been important, for we
have it on great authority that the
blind eye may be employed on really
special occasions, but the fellow stood
determinedly in the middle of the road,
and even traffic men, we have always
insisted, should not be run over except
on great provocation.

"All traffic stopped between 12 and
2," he said; "the KING is passing by."

We looked blankly at one another.
I have an extraordinary respect for HIS
MAJESTY, but I did wish that he did
more of his work by aeroplane at times.

We ate sandwiches, selected and
sited positions for sniping the royal
progress with our No. 2 Brownies and
photographed everything we saw, including
an American cooker, the historic
"Goldfish Chateau," and a Belgian
leading a little pig, with the inscription,
"The only good Bosch in the country";
but on the whole Ypres on a Sunday
afternoon is hardly more exciting than
the "great commercial centre" of Scotland.

At intervals the Staff dashed up and
spoke a word or two to the traffic man,
but they departed again and nothing
happened. We <i>all</i> had a turn at that
traffic man, and what we don't know
about his home life, pre-war and probable
post-war troubles, isn't worth
putting on any demobilisation paper.
And each time we tackled him we got a
different idea of the KING'S movements--HIS MAJESTY
must have had an extraordinarily
complex journey that day.

Suddenly we were free! The KING
was going to lunch near the Cloth Hall
and would not be by till 2.30 P.M.
Knowing that <i>any</i> order emanating
from a Staff is liable to instant cancellation
we rushed back to the car and
told the driver to "Go!" with the "G"
hard, as in shell fire. Whether we went
round or over the traffic man I don't
know, but we slid with terrific speed
into Ypres. Traffic was a little congested
round the ruined cathedral, and
we barged right up against a panting
Ford, which had one lung completely
gone and the other seemingly a little
porous. A stream of traffic was coming
down our side of the road; no matter,
we must get on. Urged on by our advice
the driver pulled out from behind
the dying Ford and tried to pass. It
was fearfully exciting. Some Staff on
the bank began to wave to us. Thinking
perhaps they knew some of us, or
thought the girls looked nice, I smiled
and nodded back. More Staff waved
more arms. We were awfully pleased
with our reception. Still three abreast
on the road, the Ford having flickered
up before death, we reached the crossroads
as a large car with a flag on it
came round the corner. The car stopped
dead. So did we. The two cars glared
at each other. The Ford writhed forward
hideously in its death agony. I
thought I felt funny, and when Vee
whispered something about "the Royal
Standard" I knew why. Royal Standard?
Good Lord! I had visions of
three laboriously acquired pips being
torn from my sleeves by outraged
authorities. The air was rent by my
wild yell to our driver to go on--<i>go on</i>
and carry the Ford with us on our
bonnet if necessary.

What happened next is not very clear
in my memory. I have a hazy picture
of purple A.P.M.'s, of our GEORGE sitting
calmly in a Rolls Royce, of irrepressible
woman poking a No. 2
Brownie against the window of our car
and trying to find a perfectly good king
in a small viewfinder; of the Colonel on
my right saluting, with a fearful waggle
of the hand, without his hat on,
that article having been simply swept
off by my own tremendous
"circular-motion-thumb-close-to-the-forefinger-touching-the-peak-of-the-cap,
etc., etc." Through the haze I saw HIS MAJESTY
graciously return our salute and I seem
to recollect Vee taking his salute as a
personal compliment to the feminine
element in the car, and smiling back
delightedly in return.

The next thing I remember was that
the car had passed, the traffic man was
gazing reproachfully at us, the Ford had
expired and our chauffeur had stopped
his engine. I don't know what Sadie
did all this time, but since, from her
position, she must have seen the
whole thing in better perspective, I
don't wonder the girl looked white.

Returning to consciousness I heard
Vee utter a tremendous sigh of intense
satisfaction.

"I <i>sniped</i> him," she said, and cuddled
the No. 2 Brownie affectionately.

"Did you turn it round after the last
one?" I asked suddenly.

"No, didn't you?"

And of course we hadn't. And there,
in the undeveloped spool lies HIS MAJESTY
superimposed on the back of the
Bosch piglet we had photographed outside
Ypres. Isn't that just the hardest of luck?

I'm going to ask if I can develop the
film without running the risk of losing
my commission. After all it's not so
very inappropriate, is it?

I admire all poilus, and especially did I admire Pierre.

on a hospital ship plying between ---- and ---- to
wheel about the more fortunate of the patients. On the

and immediately ported my helm. He bore down on his,
keeping to his right, and we collided.

"Keep to your left, you fool!" I cried as the crash came.

"<i>Mais non! le droit, M'sieur.</i>"

Here was a deadlock indeed. It was an English ship,
therefore the English rule of the road should be maintained.
On the other hand, the fact that we were still
in French waters was in his favour. But my stubborn
British will would not give way, and Heaven knows how
long we should have remained there had not one of the
invalids grunted, "Caan't thee keep t' the rule o' the
waater?" and I saw a dignified way out of the difficulty.
I withdrew to the right, and we passed on with no animosity
towards one another. Still, it was a near thing for
the Entente.

<h2>THE NEW GAME.</h2>

If Hubbard were not my friend I should describe him as
one of the most amiable and most muddle-headed of mankind.
Under the influence of his mind things that are
quite clear become confused and lose themselves in long
vistas of statement and sub-statement and sub-sub-statement,
and a plain tale is darkened until at the end nothing
is left of what it originally was. If you don't believe me
listen to what follows.

We were sitting in the drawing-room one evening
recently; the various topics of the day having been more
or less exhausted, somebody proposed a round game as a
diversion. Hubbard saw his chance and dashed in. "Yes,
by Jove," he said, "let's have the new game of 'Likenesses;'
it's a perfectly ripping game. I played it the other day
and never laughed so much in my life."

"How do you play it?" I said.

"Oh," said Hubbard, "it's one of the easiest games in
the world. All you have to do is to keep your mind clear
and remember what you are driving at."

"Right," I said. "But what are you driving at?"

"Well," said Hubbard, "one of us goes out or stops his
ears and the rest choose somebody."

"There's nothing very new about that," I said; "I've
played it a thousand times."

"Wait a bit," said Hubbard, "and don't be so ready to
plunge. I tell you this is an entirely new and original
game."

"Let him," said somebody else, "get on with it in his
own way or we shall be here till past midnight. Go ahead,
Hubbard."

"Well," said Hubbard, "you choose somebody to be a
likeness. When your man comes in again he begins to ask
questions."

"Vegetable, animal or mineral," said Butterfield, "I
knew it was."

"No, it isn't," said Hubbard. "The man who has gone
out and has come in says to you, What food does the
person you've chosen remind you of? and you say tapioca
pudding or beef-steak and kidney pie."

"But," I said, "there's nobody in the whole wide world
who reminds me of either of those things."

"Well, you can choose your own food," said Hubbard.
"If you don't like tapioca pudding you can answer scrambled
eggs. Only scrambled eggs must remind you of the
person you have in your mind. Then you go on to the
next man, and you ask him what cloth he reminds you of,
and he answers tweed or Irish frieze or best Angola."

"Can anybody," said Butterfield, "tell me what 'best
Angola' means? I've seen it often in my tailor's bills;
mostly, I think, as waistcoats, but I've never known what
it really is. If I had to guess now I should say it is something
composed in equal parts of fancy waistcoats, tapioca
pudding and scrambled eggs."

"Well, you'd be wrong," said Hubbard; "it's nothing
of the sort. When you have got as far as scrambled eggs
your man ought to begin to have a faint glimmering--"

"But," I said, "there's the tapioca pudding. What are
you going to do with that? You can't be allowed to play
fast and loose with that."

"Don't you see," said Hubbard, "that that's a mere
example and now done with? Do please remember that we
have got on to Irish frieze. You must allow me to explain
the game in my own way. Now your man tackles the next
person in turn. What building, he asks, does he remind
you of? and the answer is Cologne Cathedral or the Bank
of England."

"It would be difficult to choose anyone who reminded
me of either of those celebrated structures," I said, "but
I'll take the Bank of England for choice."

"But," said Hubbard, "you don't <i>take</i> either of them,
you see it in a flash and it's gone."

"What do you see in a flash?" I said.

"The building that the man who has gone out and is
asking questions in order to guess the person everybody is
thinking of reminds you of," said Hubbard.

"Oh, yes. That makes it absolutely clear," said Butterfield.
"Let's get to work. Personally I haven't got
beyond scrambled eggs."

"And I am lost in tapioca," I said. "Let's get to bed."
That's as far as Hubbard ever got with the explanation of
his game. We left him struggling and went to bed.

<h2>THE TRUTHFUL TRAVELLER.</h2>

/*
All my life I've been a rover; I have ranged the wide world over,
  And I've had the very devil of a time;
I've philandered through Alsatia with the nautch-girl and the geisha;
  I have heard the bells of San Marino chime.

I've hobnobbed in Honolulu with the Zouave and the Zulu,
  I have fought against the Turks at Spion Kop;
In a spirit of bravado I've accosted the MIKADO
  And familiarly addressed him as "Old Top."

I've been captured by banditti, kissed a squaw in Salt Lake City,
  Carved my name upon the tomb of LI HUNG CHANG,
And been overcome by toddy where the turbid Irrawaddy
  Winds its way from Cincinnati to Penang.

I have crossed the far-famed ferry from Port Said to Pondicherry;
  In a droschky shot the rapids at Hongkong;
I have pounded to a jelly dancing dervishes at Delhi,
  And I've chased the chimpanzee at Chittagong.

I've smoked baksheesh in pagodas, stood a Dago Scotch-and-sodas,
  Scaled the mighty Mississippi's snow-clad peaks,
Galloped madly on a llama through lagoons at Yokohama
  And found rubies at Magillicuddy's Reeks.

Where the Tagus joins the Hooghly I have bowled the wily googly,
  I have heard the howdah's howl at Hyderabad;
On a rickshaw I've gone sailing, with my boomerang impaling
  Hooded cobras on the ice-floes off Bagdad.

I have slain the beri-beri with a ball from my knobkerry;
  I have climbed the Pole and leapt across the Line;
I've seen seals in Abyssinia and volcanoes in Virginia,
  And I've dived into the shark-infested Rhine.

From the pemmican's fierce claws and the tiffin's gaping jaws
  I have never shrunk in abject terror yet;
In the jungle I have tracked them and attacked them and then hacked them
  Into mincemeat with my trusty calumet.

I have interviewed the MULLAH, KRUGER, MENELIK, ABDULLAH,
  LOBENGULA, SITTING BULL and Clan-na-Gael;
When I think of where I've been, what I've done and what I've seen,
  I'm surprised that I'm alive to tell the tale.

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>).</h4>

Battle-books have already come to wear (even in so
short a time) a strangely archaic aspect. But <i>Through the
Hindenburg Line</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is, as its name
tells you, nearer to date than most. The writer, Mr. F.A.
MCKENZIE, was a Canadian war correspondent whom the
Canadian Staff, believing (as he himself says) "that the
right place for a war correspondent is where he can see
what he is supposed to describe," allowed to live among
the troops in the front line. As a result of this unusual
privilege, his pictures of the great fights in the last stages
of the War have the reality of personal experience. The
actual smashing of the Line, for example, is an epic of
heroism and achievement still hardly realised by people at
home, who cling to an idea that the final victories were
gained over an enemy enfeebled and at disadvantage. There
are other chapters in the record that may perhaps hardly
be welcomed at this moment by those amiable sentimentalists
who would have us treat the enemy as a Bosch and
a brother. The hospital raid at Etaples is one of them;
when, even after the light of the burning huts had made
ignorance impossible, the gentle Hun, swooping low, swept
with machine-gun fire the nurses and doctors who were
attempting to remove the wounded. That, I think, is a
memory that will linger. Another picture, queerly disproportionate
in the anger it excites, is that of the fruit garden
in a great country house, with its wealth of famous old peach
and pear trees still in place along the walls, but every one
methodically sawn through. By comparison a trifling
crime, but somehow I may forget other things more easily.
One would welcome the revised judgment of Dr. SOLF
upon this particular expression of the German spirit.

To those who have been persuaded by writers like Mr.
H.G. WELLS that the horse has not and ought not to have
any part in modern warfare, Captain SIDNEY GALTREY'S
<i>The Horse and the War</i> ("COUNTRY LIFE") will come as a
revelation. Mr. WELLS has said that the sight of a soldier
wearing spurs makes him sick, or words to that effect; yet
so neglectful were our military authorities of Mr. WELLS'S
opinions and teaching that they went on steadily adding
horses, many of them cavalry horses, to the Army. We
began the War with twenty-five thousand horses, and we
finished it with considerably more than a million, to say
nothing of the mules, who diffused an air of cynical amusement
over the military proceedings in which they were
compelled to bear a part. This may conceivably be one
more proof in Mr. WELLS'S eyes of our incurable stupidity.
But those who have watched the work of our armies at
close quarters will be the last to agree with him. Captain
GALTREY in fact proves his case. He has an enthusiasm
for horses and has written a most interesting book. The
illustrations are excellent and appropriate, and the book is
admirably got up.

Valour is apt to get the better of discretion in any novel
that attempts to be quite up to date with a political subject.
Mrs. TWEEDALE places <i>The Veiled Woman</i> (JENKINS) in
some vague period later than August, 1914, largely in order
to decry a Government that really by now one fails to
-----------------------File:  52.png----------------------------
identify, and to let off sundry feminist squibs and crackers
which, in view of the present position of woman suffrage,
can only be described as fireworks half-price on the 6th of
November. Further, to get all my grumbles frankly over,
she so constantly makes sweeping assertions against the
other sex that even the most chivalrous of male reviewers
may be inclined to kick. To hear a lady pronounce once
or twice that the males of the species are obviously diminishing
in stature and strength, or that the whole programme
of the earth's return to the highest ideals is in woman's
hands, may be good for the masculine soul, but after a
while it brings up vividly BESANT'S story of <i>The Revolt of
Man</i>--what happened then and just why. The claim to a
monopoly of self-sacrifice in particular comes very badly in
war-time. All the same, if you cut out this top-hamper
the story of <i>The Veiled Woman</i> on its personal side is
distinctly a good one. I wished the heroine had not spoiled
her fine enthusiasms by mixing them so freely with a
personal vendetta; but after all it is not the characterisation
that intrigues one here. The plot--which I will not
spoil by giving it away--goes
excellently, and works up to a capital climax.

The best I can honestly say of <i>Tony Heron</i> (COLLINS) is
that it has all the makings of a good novel, but unfortunately
stops there, unmade or rather unvitalized. It is the
tale of a boy's upbringing by a sternly antagonistic father,
of his growth to maturity, his love affairs, and in due course
his relations with his own son. All the events happen that
are proper to a scheme of this type; but somehow, despite
the fact that Mr. C. KENNETT BURROW wields a practised
and often picturesque pen, the whole affair remains a
literary exercise and declines to come alive. Perhaps in
justice I should except two characters, <i>Roland</i>, the sturdy-son
born out of wedlock to <i>Tony</i>, and <i>Phil</i>, weakling child
of old <i>Heron</i> by a second marriage. Both these and the
relation of the pair to each other furnish a pleasant contrast
to the anæmia which seems to affect the rest of the
tale. Stay, there is yet another, <i>Kenrick</i>, the private tutor
of <i>Tony</i>, whose treatment by the author is at least vigorous.
I found him just a little surprising. A creature, we are
told, over fond of good food and wine, who, dining with his
pupil on the latter's sixteenth birthday and attempting
convivial airs, is shown his place with a promptitude recalling
the best manner of the eighteenth century. Subsequently,
one gathers, he took to chronic alcoholism, combined
with amateur blackmail; and a final appearance shows the
fellow dribbling wine over the evening shirt, to whose wear
the author is at pains to tell us he was unused. Clearly
a low race, these tutors, about whom I seem hitherto to
have been strangely misinformed.

Captain ROBERT B. ROSS has made excellent business of
<i>The Fifty-First in France</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON). In
any case there could be no doubts about the merits of this
famous Scottish territorial division; it is one of the very
many British divisions which has proved itself the best of
all. I recall its first appearance at the Front as a
constituted unit, and
can speak to it that the
impression its arrival
caused was welcome
and comforting. But
our author is not only
a soldier; he has also
the literary art. Clearly
he appreciates that a
fine subject is not all
that is wanted to make
a good book; that one
needs, for instance, the
gift of observation, the
power of conveying an
impression, and a reserve
of humour always
ready at need. All
these are his in abundance.
His book treats
of two earlier periods
of the war; the second,
the long-drawn offensive
of the Somme,
will make the most intimate appeal to men of his
own and the other divisions involved. To those who
knew the affair at first hand the story will recall much
that they saw and felt themselves; often they will recognise
a map-reading or will come across the name of a
humble billet which they too regarded as a paradise
replete with every modern comfort. Upon those who now
learn it for the first time a deep and enduring impression
will be produced. Captain Ross writes always with a due
respect for the serious nature of his subject; but there are
times when he breaks away from his military and literary
discipline. There is for example, a moment when he dines
well, "no more wisely than was desirable, no less wisely
than was excusable." It must be added that the accompanying
sketches are, if not of an ambitious order, yet
of a certain merit. At any rate they assist.
