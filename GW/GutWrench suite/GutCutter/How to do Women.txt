These are instructions on how to use GutCutter and GutHammer to help make HTML versions of the "Woman through the Ages" books.

This style is similar to that prescribed for "Punch" magazine. I think it makes a very nice looking product, and should work well on other projects involving illustrations, poetry, and footnotes. Following this scheme, I have been able to produce an HTML version of a 16-page Punch in less than one hour (on top of producing the plain-text version), including preparing the illustrations. You should have some familiarity with the basic scheme, which you can find laid out in detail in the DP Forum under Uberprojects --> Punch.

This is the version of these instructions of 5 August 2005.

You are going to make two plain-text versions (Latin-1 and UTF-8) and an HTML version, in four Phases. The first phase is to make a well-marked-up version, which will be further worked on in the other three phases to produce the three final versions.

Note: The only non-Latin-1 characters that appear in these books are the oe and OE ligatures. While these are non-Latin-1, they are part of the ANSI Standard, which is well-handled by Windows Notepad, MS Word, and the GutWrench suite of programs. So the first phase of making a well-marked version may be done in either of these formats, Latin-1 or ANSI, from either of which GutCutter is able to create the final Latin-1 and UTF-8 plain-text versions, as well as the HTML version (which will be internally coded in Latin-1).

PHASE ONE. Error-checking and adding a little more mark-up.

1. Optionally, first run GutSweeper on the text file. Then go thru the text with an editor:

a) Add HTML Header markups as appropriate:
<h2>...</h2> about major article titles;
<h3>...</h3> about sub-titles and about titles of very small articles, and about titles of figures (not the entire caption);
<h4>...</h4> about bylines, etc.

b) Insert rules where needed, according to the Punch style. Between articles, use the "Thought Break" (the usual five asterisks, seven spaces apart):

       *       *       *       *       *

If an article ends at the bottom of a page, put a Thought Break after it but _just before_ the Page Separator. (This is so that the Page Number displayed in the HTML version will fall a little below the Rule--looks nicer.) It should look like this (note where the blank lines go):

... end of text of previous page.

       *       *       *       *       *
-----------------------File: 123.png----------------------------

Beginning of text of following page.....

Change the scan number in each Page Separator to the page number that appears in the scan. (You can use the GutPunch tool to do this.)

c) Move Illustrations out of articles (unless they are part of the article). Separate them from surrounding articles (or each other) with Thought Breaks.

Optional (but saves work!): Modify "[Illustration:" like these examples:
This is the most general example:
"[Illustration R30/4-2:" scales the image, named "4-2.png", to 30% and floats it right.
(Any whole number is accepted for the scaling percentage. The image name is optional.)
"[Illustration 60:" scales the image to 60% and centers it. (Any whole-number percentage is accepted.)
"[Illustration L40:" scales the image to 40% and floats it left. (Any whole-number percentage is accepted.)
"[Illustration R30:" scales the image to 30% and floats it right. (Any whole-number percentage is accepted.)
"[Illustration C:" or "[Illustration:" leaves it centered, 100% scale.
"[Illustration L:" or "[Illustration R:" floats left or right, 50% scale (default).
"Float" means justify it to one side and wrap the text around it.
This step will save you having to scale the figures in the HTML later.

d) Adjust mark-ups:
Change /*...*/ to /#...#/ around Block Quotes.
Around Tables, change /*...*/ to /$...$/ and use GutCutter's Table-making capability (see the accompanying file "How to do Tables.txt" for instructions).
(Leave /*...*/ around poetry.)
Set "oe" and "OE" ligatures as "[oe]" and "[Oe]".
If needed, add "[hand]" or "[fist]" before final NOTICE.

e) Patch up any words that are hyphenated across Page Separators (or italics or bold markup that was interrupted by a Page Separator). For hyphenated words, put the complete word either before or after the Page Separator.

2. Change any _low-line mark-ups_ of italics to <i>HTML style</i>.

If you would like common abbreviations like "etc." and "et al." to appear in italics in the HTML, add tags around them now. (They will be stripped out automatically when you create the plain-text version with GutCutter.) I like to do this around the English money: "2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>"; these also get stripped out by GutCutter (note that the periods go INSIDE the italics markups).

3. Proofread and check for errors in the usual manner:
GutAxe
Gutcheck (Guiguts is recommended!)
GutWrench
Spellchecker
(See the Checklist that comes with the GutWrench suite.)

4. Inspect.

5. You have completed making a "well-marked-up" version. Make a copy and keep it in a safe place. This file will be converted in Phases Two and Three into both the plain-text version and the HTML version.

       *       *       *       *       *

PHASE TWO: make the HTML version. Start again with the well-marked-up version you made in Phase One. If you found any errors in making the plain-text version, correct them also in this file.

1. Run GutCutter on the file with "Output As ... HTML" and the "Women (Latin-1)" style selected. The output of this program is named GCout.htm. Continue working with this file.

2. If there are illustrations: Prepare the image files for the Illustrations by cropping them from the page scans (use IrfanView or Photoshop). Name them "PAGENUMBER.png", where PAGENUMBER is the page number (e.g., 123.png, where 123 is the page number). If there is more than one on a page, name them "PAGENUMBER-1.png", etc. Put them in a folder named "images".

3. Edit the title area of the header to include the book title.

4. Fix up the page numbers. The output from GutCutter will look like this (where 002 is the scan image number):

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page002" id="page002"></a>[pg 002]</span>

This should be repaired to look like this (where the page number is 123):

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
                                   ^^^          ^^^          ^^^
(A little trick: in the first editing pass through the file in Phase One, replace the scan numbers in the Page Separators with the page numbers. Then this step will already be done.)

5. Fix up the figure captions. The output from GutCutter will look like this:

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/??.png"><img width="100%" src="images/??.png" alt="" /></a><p>??CAPTION??</p></div><h3>AN OPEN-AIR VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT AT THE FRONT</h3>
WITH "OCCASIONAL MUSIC BY THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT SECTION."]</p>

This should be repaired to look like this (where the figure's image file is named "123.png"):

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/123.png"><img width="100%" src="images/123.png" alt="" /></a><h3>AN OPEN-AIR VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT AT THE FRONT</h3>
<p>WITH "OCCASIONAL MUSIC BY THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT SECTION."</p></div>

Don't forget to adjust the parameter "width:50%;" so that the percentage reflects the width of the image with respect to the original page (i.e., full width = 100%). Also, if the figure is associated with the surrounding text, change "figcenter" to "figright" and use "width:50%;" or smaller.

6. Fix up the Footnotes. GutCutter output looks like this:

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote3" name="footnote3"></a><b>Footnote 3:</b><a href="#footnotetag3"> (return) </a>***put text here***</blockquote> This is a test.]

where 3 is the Footnote number. Repair this to look like this:

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote3" name="footnote3"></a><b>Footnote 3:</b><a href="#footnotetag3"> (return) </a>This is a test.</blockquote>

and move the Footnote where you want it (e.g., at end of Article).

(Another little trick: If, in the well-marked-up version, the footnote text falls all on a single line, it will be handled completely automatically by GutCutter and require no clean-up.)

7. Open with your favorite web-browser to inspect.

8. Check and clean up your file with Tidy, and validate it at http://validator.w3.org/. Rename this file something like "Women.htm".

You're done making the HTML version. 

       *       *       *       *       *

PHASE THREE: make the Latin-1 plain-text version:

1. Run GutCutter on the well-marked-up version of Phase One, with: 
  (radio button) Output As ... Plain Text
    and
  (menu) Style --> Women (Latin-1)
selected. This will do the following:
--Replace all HTML <hx>header</hx> tags by <b>bold</b> tags
--Remove italics markups that shouldn't be used (e.g., around <i>e.g.</i>, <i>etc.</i>)

GutCutter's output, named GCout.txt, is now a standard DP marked-up version. Continue working with this file.

2. Incorporate GutCutter's other output file, GCtoc.txt, as the Table of Contents ("CONTENTS").

3. Run GutHammer to re-wrap the text. (If you prefer, use RewrapIndent or Guiguts.)
Adjust GutHammer's settings to also:
--Apply an additive indent (select "Add") of 2 spaces to Poetry.
--Change <i>HTML-style italics mark-up</i> to _low-line markup_.
--Remove <b>HTML-style bold mark-up</b>.
(GutHammer also removes the Page Separators.)

4. Make a final inspection. It's a good idea to rerun gutcheck (in verbose mode) and GutAxe (in PPV mode). You have completed the plain-text version. Rename this file something like "Women.txt".

       *       *       *       *       *

PHASE FOUR: make the UTF-8 plain-text version:

1. Run GutCutter on the well-marked-up version of Phase One, with: 
  (radio button) Output As ... Plain Text
    and
  (menu) Style --> Women (UTF-8)
selected. This will do the following:
--Replace all HTML <hx>header</hx> tags by <b>bold</b> tags
--Remove italics markups that shouldn't be used (e.g., around <i>e.g.</i>, <i>etc.</i>)
--Replace pairs of hyphens with em-dash characters.
--Replace [oe] and [OE] with the ligature characters.

GutCutter's output, named GCout.txt, is now a standard DP marked-up version with oe and OE ligatures and em-dash characters (ANSI format file). Continue working with this file.

2. Incorporate GutCutter's other output file, GCtoc.txt, as the Table of Contents ("CONTENTS").

3. Run GutHammer to re-wrap the text. (If you prefer, use RewrapIndent or Guiguts.)
Adjust GutHammer's settings to also:
--Apply an additive indent (select "Add") of 2 spaces to Poetry.
--Change <i>HTML-style italics mark-up</i> to _low-line markup_.
--Remove <b>HTML-style bold mark-up</b>.
(GutHammer also removes the Page Separators.)

4. Open this file in Windows Notepad, then save it in UTF-8 format.

5. Make a final inspection. It's a good idea to rerun gutcheck (in verbose mode) and GutAxe (in PPV mode). You have completed the UTF-8 plain-text version. Rename this file something like "Women-u.txt".
