These are instructions on how to use GutCutter and GutHammer to help make an HTML version of "International Weekly Miscellany" magazine. The style is similar to that prescribed for "Punch" magazine by the PM, Jon Ingram. To use this, you should have some familiarity with the basic scheme, which you can find laid out in detail in the DP Forum under Uberprojects --> Punch.

This is the version of these instructions of 2 December 2004.

You are going to make both a plain-text version and an HTML version, in three Phases. The first phase is to make a well-marked-up version, which will be further worked on in the other two phases to produce both final versions.

       *       *       *       *       *

PHASE ONE. Error-checking and adding a little more mark-up.

1. Optionally, first run GutSweeper on the text file. Then go thru the text with an editor:

a) Add HTML Header markups as appropriate:
<h2>...</h2> about major article titles;
<h3>...</h3> about sub-titles and about titles of very small articles, and about titles of figures (not the entire caption);
<h4>...</h4> about bylines, etc.

b) Insert rules where needed, according to the Punch style. Between major articles, use the "Thought Break" (the usual five asterisks, seven spaces apart):

       *       *       *       *       *

or this:

       *       *       *       *       *long

Within articles or between minor articles within larger sections (such as "Deaths" or "Poetry"), use this form:

       *       *       *       *       *short

If an article ends at the bottom of a page, put a Thought Break after it but _just before_ the Page Separator. (This is so that the Page Number displayed in the HTML version will fall a little below the Rule--looks nicer.) It should look like this (note where the blank lines go):

... end of text of previous page.

       *       *       *       *       *
-----------------------File: 123.png----------------------------

Beginning of text of following page.....

Change the scan number in each Page Separator to the page number that appears in the scan. You can use the GutPunch tool to do this.

c) Move Illustrations out of articles (unless they are part of the article). Separate them from surrounding articles (or each other) with Thought Breaks.

Optional: Modify "[Illustration:" like these examples:
"[Illustration R30/4-2:" scales the image, named "4-2.png", to 30% and floats it right.
(Any whole number is accepted for the scaling percentage. The image name is optional.)
"[Illustration 60:" scales the image to 60% (centered). (Any whole-number percentage is accepted.)
"[Illustration L40:" scales the image to 40% and floats it left. (Any whole-number percentage is accepted.)
"[Illustration R30:" scales the image to 30% and floats it right. (Any whole-number percentage is accepted.)
"[Illustration C:" or "[Illustration:" leaves it centered, 100% scale.
"[Illustration L:" or "[Illustration R:" floats left or right, 50% scale (default).
"Float" means justify it to one side and wrap the text around it.
This step will save you having to scale the figures in the HTML later.

d) Adjust mark-ups:
Change /*...*/ to /#...#/ around Block Quotes.
Around Tables, change /*...*/ to /$...$/ and use GutCutter's Table-making capability (see the accompanying file "How to do Tables.txt" for instructions).
(Leave /*...*/ around poetry.)

e) Patch up any words that are hyphenated across Page Separators (or italics or bold markup that was interrupted by a Page Separator). For hyphenated words, put the complete word either before or after the Page Separator.

2. Change any _low-line mark-ups_ of italics to <i>HTML style</i>.

If you would like common abbreviations like "etc." and "et al." to appear in italics in the HTML, add tags around them now. (They will be stripped out automatically when you create the plain-text version with GutCutter.) I like to do this around the English money: "2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>"; these also get stripped out by GutCutter (note that the periods go INSIDE the italics markups).

3. Proofread and check for errors in the usual manner:
GutAxe
Gutcheck (Guiguts is recommended!)
GutWrench
Spellchecker
(See the Checklist that comes with the GutWrench suite.)

4. Inspect.

5. You have completed making a "well-marked-up" version. Make a copy and keep it in a safe place. This file will be converted in Phases Two and Three into both the plain-text version and the HTML version.

       *       *       *       *       *

PHASE TWO: make the plain-text version:

1. Run GutCutter on the well-marked-up version of Phase One, with: 
  (radio button) Output As ... Plain Text
    and
  (menu) Style --> Intl. Weekly Misc.
selected. This will do the following:
--Replace HTML <hx>header</hx> tags by <b>bold</b> tags
--Remove italics markups that shouldn't be used (e.g., around <i>e.g.</i>, <i>etc.</i>)

GutCutter's output, named GCout.txt, is now a standard DP marked-up version. Continue working with this file.

2. Edit the beginning of this file to include the proper title information. For "International Weekly Miscellany", it should look like this:

INTERNATIONAL WEEKLY MISCELLANY

Of Literature, Art, and Science.

       *       *       *       *       *

Vol. I. NEW YORK, JULY 15, 1850. No. 3.

       *       *       *       *       *

Then leave four blank lines before the title of the first article.

3. Run GutHammer to re-wrap the text. (If you prefer, use RewrapIndent or Guiguts.)
Adjust GutHammer's settings to also:
--Apply an additive indent (select "Add") of 2 spaces to Poetry.
--Change <i>HTML-style italics mark-up</i> to _low-line markup_.
--Change text within <b>HTML-style bold mark-up</b> to ALL CAPS.
(GutHammer also removes the Page Separators.)

4. Make a final inspection. It's a good idea to rerun gutcheck (in verbose mode) and GutAxe (in PPV mode). You have completed the plain-text version. Rename this file "IWM.txt".

       *       *       *       *       *

PHASE THREE: make the HTML version. Start again with the well-marked-up version you made in Phase One. If you found any errors in making the plain-text version, correct them also in this file.

1. Run GutCutter on the file with "Output As ... HTML" and the "Intl. Weekly Misc." style selected. The output of this program is named GCout.htm. Continue working with this file.

2. Prepare the image files for the Illustrations by cropping them from the page scans (use IrfanView or Photoshop). Name them "PAGENUMBER.png", where PAGENUMBER is the page number (e.g., 123.png, where 123 is the page number). If there is more than one on a page, name them "PAGENUMBER-1.png", etc. Put them in a folder named "images".

3. In the title area of the header, add the volume and issue numbers and the date.

4. If necessary, fix up the page numbers. The output from GutCutter will look like this (where 002 is the scan image number):

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page002" id="page002"></a>[pg 002]</span>

This should be repaired to look like this (where the page number is 123):

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
                                   ^^^          ^^^          ^^^
(A little trick: in the first editing pass through the file in Phase One, replace the scan numbers in the Page Separators with the page numbers. Then this step will already be done.)

5. Fix up the figure captions. The output from GutCutter (at worst) will look like this:

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/??.png"><img width="100%" src="images/??.png" alt="" /></a><p>??CAPTION??</p></div><h3>AN OPEN-AIR VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT AT THE FRONT</h3>
WITH "OCCASIONAL MUSIC BY THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT SECTION."]</p>

This should be repaired to look like this (where the figure's image file is named "123.png"):

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/123.png"><img width="100%" src="images/123.png" alt="" /></a><h3>AN OPEN-AIR VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT AT THE FRONT</h3>
<p>WITH "OCCASIONAL MUSIC BY THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT SECTION."</p></div>

Don't forget to adjust the parameter "width:50%;" so that the percentage reflects the width of the image with respect to the original page (i.e., full width = 100%). Also, if the figure is associated with the surrounding text, change "figcenter" to "figright" and use "width:50%;" or smaller.

6. Fix up the Footnotes. GutCutter output looks like this:

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote3" name="footnote3"></a><b>Footnote 3:</b><a href="#footnotetag3"> (return) </a>***put text here***</blockquote> This is a test.]

where 3 is the Footnote number. Repair this to look like this:

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote3" name="footnote3"></a><b>Footnote 3:</b><a href="#footnotetag3"> (return) </a>This is a test.</blockquote>

and move the Footnote where you want it (e.g., at end of Article).

(Another little trick: If, in the well-marked-up version, the footnote text falls all on a single line, it will be handled completely automatically by GutCutter and require no clean-up.)

7. Open with your favorite web-browser to inspect.

8. Check and clean up your file with Tidy, and validate it at http://validator.w3.org/. Rename this file "IWM.htm".

You're done making the HTML version.
