Post-processing checklist for using GutSweeper, GutAxe, GutWrench, and GutHammer:

(Paste this list at the front of your text. Remove or annotate each
item when completed. Make a note to yourself here if you complete
an item only partially. When the list is gone, you're done!)

1. Run GutSweeper (in short, with all options selected) to:
  a. Check that poetry, block-quote, and sic/stet markups are correct!
(Alerts can be ignored.)
Then, modify text (can be done in a single run) to:
  b. Break up long lines (from which proofers have removed line breaks).
  c. Remove trailing blanks.
  d. Merge double blanks.
  e. Remove blank lines at the bottom of each page
  f. "Clothe" the "naked" hyphens and dashes at the beginnings and ends of lines
(Text within CORRECT markups is not affected by the above.)
  g. Remove "*/*" interior poetry markup lines.
  h. Delete any text after markups, e.g., "/* poetry".
  i. Split "oe" and "OE" ligatures.
  j. Remove spaces within abbreviations.

2. Run GutAxe to make some quick corrections to the text.
(Alternatively, run GutAxe now to Check Text only; run it again to Modify 
Text after inspecting the text in the following step.)

3. First editing pass through the text:
  a. Clean up around Page Separators.
  b. Patch up words that were hyphenated across pages
    (put the whole word on one page or the other).
  c. Clean up front material (Title, TOC, etc.).
  d. Clean up chapter and section headings.
  e. Check that all chapter headings are present and in order.
  f. Check poetry, tables, block quotes, and similar markups.

4. Run GutJack to add HTML markups around front material and chapter and section heading.

5. GutWrench
  a. "Other Errors"
  b. "Italics and Other Markup"
  c. "Hyphens and Dashes"

6. Gutcheck, non-verbose mode
(Thundergnat's winguts GUI is recommended! At this point, 
deactivate checks for "Short Lines".)

7. GutWrench "Maps"
  a. Check Character Map for weird characters
  b. Check Page Map for unmatched italic markups
  c. "Hyphenations"
  d. "Accents"

8. Print the GW Page Map

9. Check printed Page Map against scan images
  a. Thought breaks
  b. Italic markups
  c. Other (optional)

10. GutWrench
  a. Check for errors again
  b. "Improbables"
  c. "Scannos"

11. Gutcheck, verbose mode
(Again, Thundergnat's winguts GUI is recommended!)

12. Spellcheck

13. Rewrap text (GutHammer or, for more complicated texts,
big-bill's RewrapIndent tool)

14. If uploading to Project Gutenberg, replace italic markups 
with underlines (if not done with GutHammer in Step 13).

15. Final inspection

16. You're done--remove this list!
