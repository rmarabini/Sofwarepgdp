ExeRunner--What will DPers find it good for?

Use it to run pg2html or linkchk. The command you want to run looks like this:

> pg2html.exe Mytext.txt > Myhtml.htm

or

> linkchk.exe Mytext.htm > linkout.txt

where Mytext.txt is the name of the text file, and Myhtml.htm will
be the name of the resulting HTML file. Follow these instructions:

1. Copy or move the ExeRunner.exe and pg2html.exe applications into 
the folder containing the text file you are working on.
2. Launch ExeRunner.exe (double-click it).
3. In the left menu, select pg2html.exe.
4. In the middle menu, select the text file to be converted to HTML.
5. In the frame at right, select the bottom radio button to enter the
name of a new .htm file to be created in the textbox. Alternatively,
select an existing file to overwrite from the right-hand menu.
6. Make sure the "Insert >" checkbox is selected.
7. Click "Run".
8. Answer the Message Box as to whether it is to run the proper command.
9. If you clicked "Yes", close the new Message Box by clicking "OK" and
close the Command Prompt window by clicking it and typing any letter.
If you clicked "No", choose new settings and go back to Step 7.
If you get stuck ("Run" won't work), click on the file names again.
10. Close ExeRunner.exe by clicking the "x" box at upper right.
